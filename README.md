## Description

This is an Epitech School third year project from __Application Development__ module.

We had to implement a web application that works similar to [Netvibes](https://www.netvibes.com/en).

</p>

We had to assume the role of a software architect, understand and select a wide range of existing softwares and modules libraries.

We decided to work with a Javascript Framework : [_node.js_](https://nodejs.org/en/), [_react.js_](https://reactjs.org/) and [_Create React App_](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/) boilerplate.


## Usage

To homogenize the construction of the project, we used [_Docker Compose_](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

So to build and run, only launch the following command :

```bash
docker-compose build && docker-compose run
```

> This project dependencies are managed by [_npm_](https://www.npmjs.com/).
